PerlIO::gzip version 0.20
=========================

A layer for the PerlIO system to transparently gzip/gunzip files.
**DON'T** trust it with your data.

YOU NEED PERL 5.8.0 or later.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   echo I know that I am using this at my own risk
   make install

That echo statement is particularly important.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires perl 5.8.0 or later compiler with PerlIO.
(which is now the default), and the zlib compression library.

BUGS

Threads - Currenly this module isn't threadsafe as it can't clone an open layer.
flush() doesn't really flush, just empty the buffer

TODO

Lots:

Check that concatenating to files works. Add a way of reading multiple
contactenated gzip files.
Test more
Add an open method so that things we don't like (read/write opens) are faulted
early (ie before a file is created on disk) and so that we add "b" flag to
the open for the layer below.
Test more
Rewrite flush to really flush, and write a PerlIOGzip_write() rather than
rely on PerlIOBuf_write, which calls flush() to empty the buffer each time.
Test more
Cope with crlf systems. Should this layer turn off crlf on the layer below
and turn it on on itself?
Cope with utf8. Should the utf8 flag be hiked above us?
Test more
Worry about threads.
Writing headers with fancy stuff (filename, comment, extra info, header crc)
What to about the "TEXT" flag in the gzip header
Test more
